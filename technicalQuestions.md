Programming concepts:

What are the four fundamental concepts of OOP? Explain each in your own terms.

a. ENCAPSULATION : combine all relevent data and methods into a single unit called objects. This ensure that any data related to an object can only be accessed or modify using predefined methods, which helps enhanced security and hide sensitive data.

b. INHERITANCE : a mechanisum that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviour from another class. The subclass that inherits from the parent class can either use the methods of the parent class, or it can also override its methods. This in turn promote reusable codes and established coupling of relations between different objects.

c. POLYMORPHISUM : A mechanisum that allows different classes to be treated as common classes i.e. interface, which enable pre-defined methods to be implemented across different classes. This promotes code flexibility and loose coupling between different objects.

d. ABSTRACTION: A process of simplying complex code by showing only the relevent features or methods of classes while hiding the irrelevent. Abstraction is achieved by abstract classes, interfaces as well as access modifiers. This allows developers to focus on only the functional methods, and abstracting the rest of the irrelvent codes.

What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies?

- AGILE : Project management by breaking it up into phrases. Each phase or stage involves close and continuous collaboration between stakeholders.

- WATERFALL : A clearly defined sequence of execution with project phases that do not advance until a phase receives final approval. Once a phase is completed, it can be difficult and costly to revisit a previous stage. (1. Requirement Gathering, 2. Design, 3. Implementation, 4. Test and Verifications, Deployment & Maintainance)

a. Waterfall is sequential and linear (one needs to be completed 1st b4 moving to another), while Agile is flexible and adapt to changing requirements during development process

b. Waterfall is more rigid and less flexible and can be time consuming and costly.

c. Waterfall involves less customer involvement and only covers initial requirement gathering and reviewing the final product. While agile emphasize on close collaboration with the customer at every phase, and customer is involves in prioritising feedback and reviews.

d. Waterfall emphsize more on documentation, while agile emphasize more on working software.

Explain Scrum in your own terms. What are the artifacts and rituals related to Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile methodology that is widely used for managing and organizing software development projects. It provides a flexible and iterative approach to project management, allowing teams to deliver working software in shorter timeframes while adapting to changing requirements. Scrum Team: A Scrum team is a self-organizing and cross-functional group of individuals responsible for delivering the software increments. The team typically consists of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and the Development Team. The team collaboratively works together to achieve the project goals.

What is XSS and how can it be prevented?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
